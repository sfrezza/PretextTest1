  <introduction>
  <p>John Dewey and his compatriots proposed that a central goal of higher education is "assisting individuals to develop the capacities to realise their vocation (i.e., to be effective in their preferred occupation)" 
    <xref ref="mulder_competence_2017"/>.
    Similarly pragmatic and utilitarian views of higher education were also advanced by other visionaries such as Humboldt, however the focus of his interest was largely in the development of the citizen.
 </p>
 
<p>To achieve this goal it is necessary to establish, evolve and assess the educational process by which students in computing degree programs make the transition into becoming computing professionals.
  Historically, computing education has taken a content knowledge perspective, through the definition of bodies of knowledge and program outcomes that focus on the content knowledge of the degree program <xref ref="joint_task_force_on_computing_curricula_software_2015"/>. 
  This focus on knowledge is however problematic in the 21st century computing context, where the borders between knowledge-based descriptions of computing sub-disciplines  and the broad profession of computing are becoming increasingly blurred. In computing and IT, challenges also emerge due to the complex dependencies inherent in the profound integration of these disciplines into almost every aspect of human life.
</p>

<p>This article develops an empirically driven framework (CoLeaF)
  for defining competencies in the computing disciplines in tertiary
  education. To develop CoLeaF, we applied a multi-faceted approach
  which combines a comprehensive synthesis of the literature with
  structured elicitation of graduate competencies from key stakeholder
  groups1. In particular we explored the student discourse
  surrounding professional competencies, and the development of
  conceptions of professional competencies over time. As a theoretical
  point of departure we examine the literature around the notion
  of competency as a means to describe and communicate about
  computing programs among different stakeholders. Drawing upon
  this analysis we propose a working definition of competency, and
  model competency learning, through which students develop the
  competencies of their degree programme.</p>

  <p>The aim is to provide a forward looking and sustainable approach
    to defining disciplinary competencies. We propose a shift
    in the approach from graduate learning outcomes derived from the
    Bodies of Knowledge (BoK) of the disciplinary areas. Instead, we
    propose applying a structured analysis to graduate expectations
    elicited from the stakeholders in computing education. These stakeholders
    include educators, students, industry and other employers
    of computing graduates, policy makers, professional societies, etc.
    To assist in the derivation of competencies that articulate expectations
    of graduates from tertiary computing degree programs as
    they enter professional careers and engage in civic aspects of their
    lives, we propose a theoretical model and methodology for formulating
    competencies based on input from the range of stakeholder
    communities we have identified.</p>
    <p>
      Defining a competency-based description of a computing degree
      program by using the competency model proposed here involves
      collecting empirical data through surveys and interviews with stakeholders.
      The data sets are then systematically examined by applying
      the proposed model and analytic methodology in order to derive a
      set of competencies, in which increasingly abstract competencies
      describe computing degree program objectives and graduate profile
      in terms of what its graduates are prepared to do in the workplace
      and society at large. </p>

      <p>The application of the model is demonstrated on two sets of data
        collected from academic and student stakeholder groups, which
        are analysed to formulate competencies that provide a concrete
        example of how the model and methodology are applied.</p>

        <subsection xml:id="subsec-motivation">
          <title>Motivation</title>
          <p>The educational needs of students in computing evolve in alignment
            with the development of the intellectual and practical domains that
            constitute the profession. Among the many issues involved is the
            emergence of more common understandings of what makes up computing
            as a discipline, and how computing education is described
            and communicated among various stakeholders. Answering these
            questions is critical both for determining what new developments
            further expand the depth and breadth of the discipline, and those
            that cross over into other intellectual and professional domains. In
            computing education, this is particularly important, as there are
            significant differences with respect to what is meant for a particular
            computing term in different sub-disciplines of computing, and in
            the various educational programs around the world. Thus, there
            is a critical need for a ’common currency’ to reasonably describe
            computing education programs and their respective goals.</p>

            <p>Similarly, computing is more accurately described as a family of disciplines, with reliance on three intertwined intellectual traditions: the mathematical (or analytical, theoretical, or formalist) tradition, the scientific (or empirical) tradition, and the engineering (or technological) tradition <xref ref="tedre_three_2008"/>. 
              Within all three of these intellectual traditions, the common tendency has been to develop competency models and ontologies that focus primarily on cognitive development <xref ref="sentance_taxonomies_2018"/>, and hence the prevalence of knowledge dimension. 
              Consequently, one of the motivations for this work is to propose a model and methodology that allow the goals of tertiary degree programs to extend 'beyond the cognitive' <xref ref="lynch_beyond_2009,topi_information_2017"/> and be more explicit about articulating the skills, knowledge, attitudes, and professional values expected in a graduate.
            </p>
            <p>A third motivation is to encourage tertiary computing programs to explicitly extend their focus 'beyond the technical'.  Numerous professional (e.g., \cite{the_royal_academy_of_engineering_engineering_2009}), degree program (e.g., \cite{sabin_competency-based_2018}) and disciplinary documents (e.g., \cite{ieee_computer_society_software_2014},~\cite{joint_task_force_on_computing_curricula_software_2015,task_group_on_information_technology_curricula_information_2017}) strongly suggest that computing students need to exhibit professional competency in multiple ways beyond their technical knowledge. Broadening the scope of the discipline, for example, by emphasising social aspects, can lead to more diversity in the people engaging in computer science~\cite{faulkner_technology_2001, Faulkner_2007}, and thus to a more democratic advancement of technological development.
              In this manner, a compelling competency model offers a means of integrating more explicitly expectations of computing graduates that expand beyond the technical domain.
            </p>
            <p>The normative solution to issues pertaining to meaning is to develop an ontology that creates an agreed-upon structure of language and defines an area for common use, such that this language then becomes the "common currency" for establishing shared meaning. Various attempts at developing computing education ontologies have been helpful, but are also incomplete and have had difficulty mapping across different levels of education. Sabin \textit{et al}. ~\cite{sabin_competency-based_2018} and the IT2017 report ~\cite{task_group_on_information_technology_curricula_information_2017} have shifted the curriculum discourse towards using computing competencies as a means of describing computing degree programmes in ways that can be meaningfully compared across nationalities, languages, geographical locations, and, possibly, across computing disciplines. The IT2017 report presents a scholarly-based definition of IT competency as a triad of inter-related dimensions of knowledge, skills, and dispositions situated in a professional context  ~\cite{perkins_beyond_1993, council_of_chief_state_school_officers_knowledge_2013, schussler_defining_2006,pikkarainen_competence_2014}. 
            </p>
            <p> Our goal is not to create a computing education ontology, but rather to present a  competency model and method that can be used to describe the various computing disciplines in general, and computing degree programs in particular. 
              Utilising a richer competency approach affords minting of a new currency, a newer means of describing and comparing computing degree programs and their components worldwide.
