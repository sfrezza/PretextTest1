  <title>Abstract</title>

    <p> How might the content and outcomes of tertiary education programmes
        be described and analysed in order to understand how
        they are structured and function? To address this question we develop
        a framework for modelling graduate competencies linked to
        tertiary degree programmes in the computing disciplines. While
        the focus of our work is computing the framework is applicable to
        education more broadly.
    </p>
    <p>The work presented here draws upon the pioneering curricular
        document for information technology (IT2017), curricular competency
        frameworks, other related documents such as the software
        engineering competency model (SWECOM), the Skills Framework
        for the Information Age (SFIA), current research in competency
        models, and elicitation workshop results from recent computing
        conferences.
    </p>
    <p>
        The aim is to inform the ongoing Computing Curricula (CC2020)
        project, an endeavour supported by the Association for Computing
        Machinery (ACM) and the IEEE Computer Society. We develop the
        Competency Learning Framework (CoLeaF), providing an internationally
        relevant tool for describing competencies. We argue that this competency based approach is well suited for constructing
        learning environments and assists degree programme architects in
        dealing with the challenge of developing, describing and including
        competencies relevant to computer and IT professionals.
    </p>
    <p> In this paper we demonstrate how the CoLeaF competency framework
        can be applied in practice, and though a series of case studies
        demonstrate its effectiveness and analytical power as a tool for
        describing and comparing degree programmes in the international
        higher education landscape.
